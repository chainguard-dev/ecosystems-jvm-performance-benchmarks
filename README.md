This project is a fork of https://github.com/chainguard-dev/jvm-performance-benchmarks.
The original readme is in the [README_ORIGINAL.md](README_ORIGINAL.md) file.

The fork features different artifact group, versioning system and some scripts to run the benchmarks.
Refer to git history for the list of changes.

## Versioning
Versions is in a [major].[minor] format, where [major] changes only with breaking changes to the benchmarks themselves.
Running this tool with different [minor] versions should bring no difference in the benchmark results.
